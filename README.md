## Malaria Detector CNN
*Malaria Detector CNN* is a study about the diagnosis of malaria infection in a blood cell using CNNs (from scratch and pre-trained) developed by Francesca Pezzuti and Pietro Tempesti for the Computational Intelligence and Deep Learning course at the university of Pisa.

All the CNN models have been trained using the [malaria](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/malaria?hl=en) dataset from the Tensorflow catalogue.
